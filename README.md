# gm82dx8
This extension aims to extend your control over the DirectX8 interface Game Maker 8.2 uses for rendering.

## What this enables

- vpatch for stable framerates when room speed % monitor Hz
- resize the damn backbuffer so gm8 can have proper window resizing and fullscreen
- experimental exclusive fullscreen support
- control rendering properties such as point mode, fill mode, point sprites etc
- enable or disable alpha blend, color write channels, and clear the depth buffer
- set the screen clipping region (scissor test) plus convenience projection functions
